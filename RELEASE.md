OQS-OpenSSL_1\_1\_1-stable snapshot 2021-xx-dev
===============================================

About
-----

The **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project** has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.  More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.

**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.

**open-quantum-safe/openssl** is an integration of liboqs into (a fork of) OpenSSL.  The goal of this integration is to provide easy prototyping of quantum-resistant cryptography in TLS 1.3, X.509 certificates, CMS, and S/MIME.  The integration should not be considered "production quality".

Release notes
=============

This is development branch for the 2021-xx snapshot release of OQS-OpenSSL. This release is intended to be used with liboqs version 0.7.0.

What's New
----------

This is the seventh snapshot release of OQS-OpenSSL_1\_1\_1-stable.  It is based on OpenSSL 1.1.1l.

- Update OpenSSL to version 1.1.1l.
